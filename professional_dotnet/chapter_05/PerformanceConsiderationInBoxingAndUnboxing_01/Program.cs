// Program to demonstrate Performance Consideration in Boxing and Unboxing in C# with Visual Studio
// Programmer: Srushti Battise

/*
    This example shows the performance cost of boxing/unboxing due to heap allocations and type casting.
    In high-performance scenarios, frequent boxing/unboxing should be minimized.
